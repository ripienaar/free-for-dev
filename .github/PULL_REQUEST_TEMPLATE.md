 ### Free SaaS Offering Submission

 Thank you for contributing to this list. This list is for **SaaS**
 services that offer a **free tier** to help developers evaluate and
 build something that users can later use and get support for.

 The focus of this list is quite broad but we try to keep things
 limited to that which infrastructure developers, like DevOps Practitioners,
 would find useful.

 This list is the result of more than a thousand people contributing
 to make something useful, we appreciate your efforts.

 ### Code of Conduct

 We are not here to argue with you. If you are argumentative, abusive,
 lie or missrepresent your service or are otherwise anti-social we will
 block you.

 ### Services we do not accept

   * cPanel like PHP + MySQL hosting services.
   * Free dns services that are generic frontends to CloudFlare or similar
   * Services that are verbatim copy pastes of others while adding no value
   * Fake / Temporary / Ephemeral email generators, we have enough of those
-->
